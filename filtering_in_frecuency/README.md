## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or ‚Äúto be‚Äù state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository.
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git

2. Install the required libraries.
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- Example 1

Apply low pass filter to image

1. Run the low_pass_example.py script

```
python -m examples.low_pass_example
```

- Example 2

Apply high pass filter to image

1. Run the high_pass_example.py script

```
python -m examples.high_pass_example
```

- Example 3

Check the filtering animation of multiple cuttof thresolds in a dynamic manner in Dash.

1. Run the dash.py script

```
python -m examples.dash
```
