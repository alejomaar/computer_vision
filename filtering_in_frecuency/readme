Image Frequency Filters
This is a Python library that provides an implementation of frequency filters for image processing, specifically, low-pass and high-pass filters. These filters can be applied to images to remove or enhance certain frequency components.

Installation
To install the library, run the following command:

Copy code
pip install image-frequency-filters
Usage
The library provides two main functions for applying frequency filters to images: apply_low_pass_filter and apply_high_pass_filter.

Low-pass filter
To apply a low-pass filter to an image, use the apply_low_pass_filter function. This function takes the following arguments:

img: The input image as a NumPy array.
filter_type: The type of low-pass filter to apply. The possible values are "ideal", "gaussian", and "butterworth".
filter_params: A dictionary with the parameters for the selected filter type.
Here's an example of how to use the apply_low_pass_filter function:

python
Copy code
import cv2
from image_frequency_filters import apply_low_pass_filter

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread("image.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Define the filter parameters
filter_params = {"D": 20}

# Apply the low-pass filter
filtered_img = apply_low_pass_filter(img, "gaussian", filter_params)

# Show the filtered image
cv2.imshow("Filtered Image", filtered_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
High-pass filter
To apply a high-pass filter to an image, use the apply_high_pass_filter function. This function takes the same arguments as apply_low_pass_filter.

Here's an example of how to use the apply_high_pass_filter function:

python
Copy code
import cv2
from image_frequency_filters import apply_high_pass_filter

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread("image.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Define the filter parameters
filter_params = {"D": 20}

# Apply the high-pass filter
filtered_img = apply_high_pass_filter(img, "gaussian", filter_params)

# Show the filtered image
cv2.imshow("Filtered Image", filtered_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
